        \subsection*{Question:}
            Take the following code and decompile it into assembly language.

            \inputminted{cpp}{../03-Assembly/Assembly.cpp}

            Use the debugger to view both the registers and stack, 
            running the decompiled code.\\

            Repeat this again with a release target \& notice the differences,
            showing how the optimizer has been at work.

        \subsection*{Solution:}
            {\renewcommand\fcolorbox[4][]{\textcolor{cyan}{\strut#4}}
                \inputminted{gas}{../03-Assembly/Assembly.txt}%CPP file path here
            }
        \subsection*{Test Data:}
            Not required.
        
        \subsection*{Sample Output:}
            Not required.
        \subsection*{Reflection:}
            My decision to use vscode made this considerably harder, but I managed to set up
            the ghidra decompiler, this could be down to one of many factors such as linux, gcc or ghidra
            but I did not notice a difference between release and debug targets at least within the main function.
