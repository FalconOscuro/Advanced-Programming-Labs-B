    \subsection*{Question}
        Take the following code and decompile it into assembly language.

        \inputminted{cpp}{../Tasks/03-Assembly/Assembly.cpp}

        Use the debugger to view both the registers and stack, 
        running the decompiled code.\\

        Repeat this again with a release target \& notice the differences,
        showing how the optimizer has been at work.

    \subsection*{Test Data}
        Not required.
        
    \subsection*{Sample Output}
        Not required.
    \subsection*{Reflection}
        I used vscode as the IDE so had to use ghidra, an external decompiler.
        There was no noticeable difference between the debug and release versions within the main function, 
        this is likely down to my setup.

    \subsection*{Solution}
        \begin{listing}[H]            
            {\renewcommand\fcolorbox[4][]{\textcolor{cyan}{\strut#4}}
                \inputminted[fontsize=\tiny]{gas}{../Tasks/03-Assembly/Assembly.txt}
                \caption{Decompiled assembly}
            }
        \end{listing}
